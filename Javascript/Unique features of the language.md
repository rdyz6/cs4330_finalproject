* Does the language have any particularly unique features?
* A: Yes, There are four powerful features make javascript:
 *  Browser support(use javascript, you don't have to use any plugin at all. This is because all browsers have accepted javascript as a scripting language for them and provides integrated support for it)
 * 	Can be used on client side as well as on server side
 * 	Functional programming language(function can be assigned to to either variables or another functions)
 * 	the way javascript handles objects and inheritance is bit different from conventional object oriented programming languages like Java.
