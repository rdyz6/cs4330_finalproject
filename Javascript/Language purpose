Javascript Part
*Why was javascript created?
 When javascript was invented, it was not called &quot;javascript&quot;, instead, mocha, there are some reasons for the invention of the javascripts:
 Mocha is created to make the web become more dynamic, simple, accessible to non web developer.
 Java was not suited for the type of audience that would consume Mocha: scripters, amateurs, designers. Java was just too big, too enterprisy for the role.
 Mocha was meant to be the scripting companion for Java
