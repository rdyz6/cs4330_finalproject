# Classes
## Defination
A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:
- 1.Modifiers : A class can be public or has default access (Refer this for details).
- 2.Class name: The name should begin with a initial letter (capitalized by convention).
- 3.Superclass(if any): The name of the classâ€™s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
- 4.Interfaces(if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
- 5.Body: The class body surrounded by braces, { }.
- Class defined with using class
```Java
    class Bicycle{
        int cadence = 0;
        int speed = 0;
        int gear = 0;
    }
```
## Constructors and Initializers
One of the most important sub topic would be constructors. Every class has a constructor. If we do not explicitly write a constructor for a class, the Java compiler builds a default constructor for that class.
When a new object is created, at least one constructor will be invoked. The main rule of constructors is that they should have the same name as the class. A class can have more than one constructor.
```
public class Puppy {
   public Puppy() {
   }

   public Puppy(String name) {
      // This constructor has one parameter, name.
   }
}
```
## Variable types
A class can contain any of the following variable types.
- Local variables: Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables. The variable will be      declared and initialized within the method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed.
- Instance variables: Instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method. These variables are initialized when the class is instantiated. Instance variables can be accessed from inside any method, constructor or blocks of that particular class.
- Class variables: Class variables are variables declared within a class, outside any method, with the static keyword.
