# Functional programming
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
## Higher Order Functions
In modern Java, we can easily do this. The syntax is not the best, and because there is not type inference we have to explicitly declare the function type which in Java means some kind of interface. Let’s see how.
First, let’s suppose we have a collections of objects, that is a collection of dogs and we have a function that acts on each dog. We want to be able to invoke this function on each object (dog).
```Java
@FunctionalInterface
interface DogAge {
    Integer apply(Dog dog);
}
List<Integer> getAges(List<Dog> dogs, DogAge f) {
    
    List<Integer> ages = new ArrayList<>();
    
    for (Dog dog : dogs) {
        ages.add(f.apply(dog));
    }
    
    return ages;
}
```
We define an interface that given a dog, it extracts some Integer value from it. Then, we define a function getAges that apply the passed function (interface for now) to each dog.
Next, create the actual function we want to apply over each dog.
```Java
DogAge f = dog -> dog.getAge();
getAges(dogs, f);
```
It is not have to actually define the DogAge implementation as we just to do in older Java. 
That will be the following way, but please, don’t use it any longer.
```Java
DogAge dontUseMe = new DogAge() {
    @Override
    public Integer apply(Dog dog) {
        return dog.getAge();
    }
};
```
The former is actually generated by the compiler when it sees the first one.
We can go one step deeper and do the following.
```Java
getAges(dogs, dog -> dog.getAge());
```
