* What types does the language support?
 *  A: It supports primitive types and reference types. Numbers, boolean values, and the null and undefined types are primitive.

* Are both reference and values supported?
 *  A: Yes, 
* Pass by Value:
 *  In Pass by Value, Function is called by directly passing the value of the variable as the argument. Changing the argument inside the function doesnâ€™t affect the variable passed from outside the function.

```
function callbyValue(var1, var2) { 
  console.log("Inside Call by Value Method"); 
  varOne = 100; 
  varTwo = 200; 
  console.log("varOne =" + varOne +"varTwo =" +varTwo); 
} 
let varOne = 10; 
let varTwo = 20; 
console.log("Before Call by Value Method"); 
console.log("varOne =" + varOne +"varTwo =" +varTwo); 
callByValue(varOne, varTwo) 
console.log("After Call by Value Method");
```
* The output will look like following: 100, 200, 10,20, 100, 200(so, the value actually did not change)
* Pass by reference
 *  In Passing by reference, function is called by directly passing the reference/ address of the variable as the argument. Change the argument inside the fucntion affect the variable passed from outside of the function

```
function callByReference(varObj) { 
  console.log("Inside Call by Reference Method"); 
  varObj.a = 100; 
  console.log(varObj); 
} 
let varObj = {a:1};
console.log("Before Call by Reference Method"); 
console.log(varObj);
callByReference(varObj) 
console.log("After Call by Reference Method"); 
console.log(varObj);
output will be : a:1, a:100, a:100
``` 
* Can new value types be created?
 *  A: In my opinion it can. JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:
