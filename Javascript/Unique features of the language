Unique features of the language
*Does the language have any particularly unique features?
Yes, There are four powerful features make javascript:
1.	Browser support
(use javascript, you don't have to use any plugin at all. This is because all browsers have accepted javascript as a scripting language for them and provides integrated support for it)
2.	Can be used on client side as well as on server side
3.	Functional programming language(function can be assigned to to either variables or another functions)
4.	the way javascript handles objects and inheritance is bit different from conventional object oriented programming languages like Java.
