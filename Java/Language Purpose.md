# Java's language purpose
* Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
* Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.
- There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:[17]
  - It must be "simple, object-oriented, and familiar".
  - It must be "robust and secure".
  - It must be "architecture-neutral and portable".
  - It must execute with "high performance".
  - It must be "interpreted, threaded, and dynamic"
