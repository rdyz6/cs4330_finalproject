# Procedural Programming
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.

In a procedural program, the code is king and the data is subordinate. In other words, you have programs which act on data and they're not usually tightly bound.

In the OO world, objects are the primary thing of interest. An object consists of data and the code that is allowed to act on that data, and they are very tightly bound. It is the concept of encapsulation, the hiding of information.
